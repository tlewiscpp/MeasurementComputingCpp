This file will hopefully guide you on using the mcc-libusb package
that will interface to the Measurement Computing data acquisition
devices.  This package uses libusb-1.0 (not libusb-0.1 which is not
backward compatible).  This is a complete rewrite in python of the C
drivers found in ../USB/mcc-libusb. It also uses the python hidapi
and libusb1 packages. Install these packages using pip or pip3 depending on your
installation.  Note that you need the python3 version of these packages.  

To install the python version of libusb1:
$ sudo pip install libusb1  or  easy_install libusb1

Go to https://github.com/trezor/cython-hidapi and install the python wrapper for hidapi
and read the instructions on how to install it.  Just run the test-usb*.py file in Python 3.

$ sudo apt-get install python-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
$ sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools
$ sudo pip install hidapi

Once these packages are installed, test them out using:
test-usb*.py.  On the RaspberryPi, you may need to connect the usb to an externally powered
USB HUB, as the Raspberry Pi may not supply enough power to the unit.  


Good luck,
