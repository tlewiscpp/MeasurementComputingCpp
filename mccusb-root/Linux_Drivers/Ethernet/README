This file will hopefully guide you on using the mcc-ethernet package
(C and Python) that will interface to the Measurement Computing data
acquisition devices.  There are three scenarios for interfacing to the
E-series devices:

1. The device is connected to a network where it is configured via dhcp.  To access the device
   run:   for C                       for Python
       ./test-E-1608                ./test-E-1608.py
       ./test-E-DIO24               ./test-E-DIO24.py
       ./test-E-TC                  ./test-E-TC.py
       ./test-E-TC32                ./test-E-TC32.py

2. The device is configured with an ip and is on the internet.  To access the device, run
   ./test-E-1608 <ip_address>          ./test-E-1608.py 'ip address'
   ./test-E-DIO24 <ip_address>         ./test-E-DIO24.py 'ip address'
   ./test-E-TC <ip_address>            ./test-E-TC.py 'ip address'
   ./test-E-TC32 <ip_address>          ./test-E-TC32.py 'ip address'

3. The device is connected directly to the host PC (link-local).  On the Raspberry Pi, 
   edit the file /etc/network/interfaces as follows:

   iface eth0 inet static
   address 192.168.0.10
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   broadcast 192.168.0.255
   network 192.168.0.0
   gateway 192.168.0.1

  After saving the file, release any dhcp leases by typing
  sudo rm /var/dhcp/*

  reboot
